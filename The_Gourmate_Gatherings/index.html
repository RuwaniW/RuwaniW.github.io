        <h2>American Labradors</h2>

        <p>The American Labrador has a quick mind as well as a quick body, and is often a very sensitive soul that lives to please. Extremes of sensitivity can occasionally lead to nervousness, but on the whole, temperament is sound throughout the breed.</p>

        <p>Outdoors in the open, American Labradors may have very strong hunting instincts and be more likely to pursue your local wildlife. This can be a problem for those living in rural areas or exercising their dogs in countryside populated with rabbits or squirrels!</p>

        <h2>English type of Labradors</h2>

        <p>English type Labs are often heavier than their field-bred cousins and shorter in the leg. They may also be less agile. Though this isnâ€™t always the case, and I have known some hefty show type Labs that are surprisingly good at jumping.</p>

        <p>All Labradors are very lively when young, but some show-bred Labs become somewhat more placid, slower, and 'chilled out' as they age. While some of their field-bred cousins tend to remain 'high-energy' dogs for much of their lives.</p>
